JSON: a lightweight data-interchange format, a text format that is completely language independent. 
JSON is based on 2 structures: 
1. a collections of key/value pairs. 
2. an ordered list of values.

In JSON, these structures take on these forms: 
1. object: an unordered set of key/value pairs. E.g. { name1 : value1, name2 : value2 }
2. array: an ordered collection of values. E.g. [ value1, value2, value3 ]
3. value: a string (in " "), a number, true, false, null, an object, or an array.
